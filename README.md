# BRUT-UI

A Brutalism-inspired CSS framework that emphasizes raw, unrefined aesthetics while ensuring high performance, usability, and modularity.

## Core Design Principles

- Raw, unrefined aesthetics reflecting the Brutalist style
- Minimalism with a limited color palette (primarily monochromatic with bold accent colors)
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Modular structure promoting reusability and customization
- Performance-focused with minimal CSS overhead
- Accessible design for all users
